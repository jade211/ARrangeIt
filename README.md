# ARrangeIt: Augmented Reality (AR) Virtual Home Decor App

## Project Overview

**ARrangeIt** is an Augmented Reality (AR) mobile application that enables users to visualize furniture and decorative items within their own living spaces before making a purchase. Leveraging AR technology, the app overlays virtual 3D models of furniture into real-world environments using a smartphone camera, helping users make informed home decor decisions.

## Key Features

1. **AR Room Visualization**
   - View 3D furniture and decor items overlaid in real-time through a smartphone camera.
   - Supports object positioning, movement and rotation for accurate placement in the room.

2. **Furniture Catalogue Integration**
   - Access a catalogue of 3D furniture models categorized by type (e.g., sofas, tables, decor).
   - Filter items by color, type, and price.
   - View detailed information: dimensions, pricing etc.

3. **Save Options**
   - Save room configurations for later viewing.
   - Maintain a shopping list for potential purchases.

4. **AR Measurement Tool**
   - Measure distance between two selected points using the smartphone camera.
