## SECTION B

### Introduction

> Our project will focus on developing an augmented reality (AR) - based mobile application for home decor. This app will allow users to visualise furniture and decorative items in their living spaces in order to get a feeling for how the item(s) will look prior to making a purchase. By using AR technology, users can view virtual 3D models of furniture overlaid onto their real-world environment through their smartphone camera. This will help users to make an informed decision about how furniture will look and fit in their homes allowing them to confidently buy the item knowing they made a correct choice.

### Outline

> The proposed project is an AR android app that enables users to browse a catalogue of furniture, place virtual furniture items in their physical space using their phone’s camera, and save the arrangement for future reference. The app will allow users to adjust the size and orientation of the virtual items and explore different styles and colours to suit their preferences. Key features will include furniture catalogue integration, room scanning, object scaling, and saving configurations.

### Background

> The idea for this project came from the need for a more optimised, interactive shopping experience for home decor. Traditional shopping for furniture often leaves customers uncertain about how items will look or fit in their homes. AR technology bridges this gap by allowing users to visualise furniture in real-time, at scale and in their own spaces.
>
>This app is inspired by existing AR home design tools, such as the IKEA home design feature. Through our experience with this feature, we have found it lacks many optimisations and have identified several areas that could be improved. Firstly, it's limited to Apple devices, restricting access for many users. Secondly, the usability of the feature could be enhanced as the scaling is difficult to use. Introducing helper buttons could streamline the scaling process to ensure the user's scaling preference is met. Additionally, we noticed the colouring of the products chosen by the user do not appear the correct shade shown in the catalogue due to the app highlighting the product when placed in the room. Our app aims to target these optimisations and also allow users to place multiple pieces of furniture to ensure the room can be fully styled, which is not available on the IKEA app.
>
>We’ve also drawn inspiration from other AR tools, such as Specsavers' online feature that allows users to try on glasses virtually before purchasing. The combination of both of these inspirations led to the development of this idea.


### Achievements

> The project will provide several functionalities:
> - Real-time AR visualisation of 3D furniture models in users’ rooms.
> - Ability to browse and filter furniture items in a catalogue based on item, colour, material, and price.
> - Room scanning for suggesting suitable furniture based on room dimensions and style.
> - Object scaling and rotation for accurate placement of items in a room.
> - Customisation of furniture finishes and the ability to save room configurations.
> - An AR measurement tool to help users measure the dimensions of their rooms or furniture.
>
> The primary users will be homeowners, renters, interior designers, or anyone looking to furnish or redecorate a space.


### Justification

> From researching into this idea we have found that AR can significantly improve decision-making in retail by offering an immersive experience where users can test products in context. A study by DigitalBridge found that 69% of consumers expect retailers to launch AR apps to allow them to preview items in their own homes. This shows a growing demand for AR technology in retail that this app will be satisfying. This app can be used with other retailer technology as an added feature whereby their catalogue of products can be viewed by consumers in real-time.
>
> Additionally, a study from Harvard Business Review highlights that augmented reality increases consumer confidence and engagement during the shopping process. This directly correlates with improved decision-making and higher customer satisfaction, making AR an important tool for retailers​.
>
> Users planning to redecorate or furnish their homes often struggle to visualise how different furniture pieces will fit or look in their spaces. This app allows them to preview items placed in their home in real-time before making any purchase decisions, reducing uncertainty. It’s particularly helpful during times when in-store visits are difficult or inconvenient such as during busy schedules or even periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, in which stores were closed and in-store perusal was undoable.
>
> The app can be used in any living space - homes, offices, or even outdoor settings. It's ideal for those furnishing a new home, redecorating an existing space, or designing rooms for specific functions, such as home offices, playrooms, or studios. It can be particularly beneficial for use in rooms where space is limited, helping users maximise room layouts and avoid purchasing items that are too large or unsuitable.
>
> By overlaying virtual 3D furniture models in the user's real-world environment, the app eliminates the guesswork of fitting and styling. Furthermore, the ability to scale, rotate, and place multiple items in the same scene provides a realistic and practical approach to room design.
